If such modification is not possible, the relevant provision or part-provision shall be deemed deleted. Any modification to or deletion of a provision or part-provision under this clause shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the rest of the Contract. </li><li> <b>Notices.</b> <ul style="list-style-type: lower-latin;"> <li> Any notice or other communication given to a party under or in connection with the Contract shall be in writing. </li><li> Any notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been received: if delivered by hand, on signature of a delivery receipt or at the time the notice is left at the proper address; if sent by pre-paid first class post or other next working day delivery service, at 9.00 am on the second Business Day after posting or at the time recorded by the delivery service; or, if sent by fax or email, at 9.00 am on the next Business Day after transmission. </li><li> This clause does not apply to the service of any proceedings or other documents in any legal action or, where applicable, any other method of dispute resolution. </li></ul> </li><li> <b>Third party rights.</b> <ul style="list-style-type: lower-latin;"> <li> Unless it expressly states otherwise, the Contract does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of the Contract. </li><li> The rights of the parties to rescind or vary the Contract are not subject to the consent of any other person. </li></ul> </li><li> <b>Governing law.</b> The Contract, and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales. </li><li> <b>Jurisdiction.</b> Each party irrevocably agrees that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with the Contract or its subject matter or formation. </li></ol> </li></ol> </div></div>', ## block content, place iline HTML here
